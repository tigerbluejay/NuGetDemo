"# NuGetDemo" 
This project simply incorporates two packages: Humanizer and Newtonsoft.Json and provides a basic implementation on a console application.

The Humanizer package converts into “humanly readable” terms a measure of milliseconds.

The Newtonsoft.Json package converts an object of class “Mascot” into its Json representation with indentation.
